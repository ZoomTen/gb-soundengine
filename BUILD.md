# Windows

You'll gonna need [**RGBDS**](https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/releases/) and [**dd**](http://www.chrysocome.net/dd) to compile the GBS.

Open the command prompt, go to the directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository and type in:

	build-gbs gbstest
	
It should produce a file named "gbstest_out.gbs" that you can play on foobar2000 (with foo_gep) or Winamp (with Nezplug)
