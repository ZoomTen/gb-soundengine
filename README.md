# ZoomTen's GameBoy Sound Engine

This is a simple yet dumb sound engine for the GameBoy.

I pretty much made this to learn how GameBoy sound plays. It's heavily commented too.

Includes:
* This readme
* GPL v2 license
* The sound engine itself
* code to build a GBS file

(coming soon: Sound test ROM)

[**BUILD.md**](BUILD.md) contains instructions to build a GBS file with the sound engine.
