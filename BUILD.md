# Windows

You'll gonna need [**RGBDS**](https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/releases/) and [**dd**](http://www.chrysocome.net/dd) to compile the GBS. Put them in the directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository.

Run the make.bat file.
	
It should produce a file named "gbstest_out.gbs" that you can play on foobar2000 (with foo_gep) or Winamp (with Nezplug)
